# Analyzing Historical Stock Data

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical stock data to gain insights into market trends and stock performance. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter notebook with Python, utilizing libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

## Key Features

- **Data Loading**: Importing historical stock data for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
- **Data Manipulation**: Creating new columns, filtering data, and performing various transformations.
- **Data Visualization**: Using seaborn and matplotlib to create insightful graphs and charts.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `Analysing Historical Stock.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (not included in this repository for privacy reasons).
